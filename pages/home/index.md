### An ontology-based approach for software architecture recommendations

This is a prototypical implementation of web editor that provides authors of software architecture documentation with 
context related recommendations. Two types of recommendations are provided using existing broad cross-domain 
DBpedia ontology to support architects during the decision-making process (more details could be found [here](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/9cr85n66nn6c/An-ontology-based-approach-for-software-architecture-recommendations)).   
To implement this client application the [React Static Boilerplate](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate) has been used.

To try it out:
1) Enter your text/drop the doc(x) document in upload area/ use provided text;
2) Press "Refresh" button to get the text processed;
3) Click one of the annotations to see generated recommendations.
