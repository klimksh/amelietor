#### An ontology-based approach for software architecture recommendations

This is a prototypical implementation of web editor that provides authors of software architecture documentation with 
context related recommendations. Two types of recommendations are provided using existing broad cross-domain 
DBpedia ontology to support architects during the decision-making process (more details could be found [here](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/9cr85n66nn6c/An-ontology-based-approach-for-software-architecture-recommendations)).
